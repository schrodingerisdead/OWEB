##TORTOISE-HARE race

The following JavaScript game (as seen in *Deitel's Internet and World Wide Web: How to Program 10.17*)is used to describe and visualize **Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm** or **Hare-Tortoise algorithm**. It's basically a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, moving through the sequence at different speeds. The algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list. However in this problem, a linked list is not used. 
#### EXPLANATION

Using a random number generator(1:10) we get the percentage of a certain movement from the hare or the tortoise which we use to define each of their movements. In the HTML body we have div elements for the button and using Events in our JavaScript code we help generate the simulation of the race!
